            <h2>About Conor McGregor</h2>
            <img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/rockcms/2024-06/240613-conor-mcgregor-2021-ac-618p-72c1b9.jpg" alt="Conor McGregor">
            <p>Conor Anthony McGregor (born 14 July 1988) is an Irish professional mixed martial artist, professional boxer, businessman, and actor. He is a former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Featherweight and Lightweight Champion, becoming the first UFC fighter to hold UFC championships in two weight classes simultaneously.</p>

            <p>McGregor is the biggest pay-per-view (PPV) draw in mixed martial arts (MMA) history, having headlined the five highest-selling UFC PPV events. His bout with Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 drew 2.4 million PPV buys, the most ever for an MMA event. His debut professional boxing match, during which he was defeated by Floyd Mayweather Jr., drew over 5.3 million buys across the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>McGregor was ranked as the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2021, earning a reported $180 million. He also featured in the list in 2018, when he was ranked fourth, with a reported income of $99 million.</p>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Conor Anthony McGregor was born in Dublin, Ireland. He was raised in Crumlin and attended Irish-language schools — the Gaelscoil Scoil Mológa, in Harold's Cross, at primary level, and Gaelcholáiste Coláiste de hÍde in Tallaght at secondary level, where he also developed his passion for sport, playing football. At the age of 12, he also began boxing at Crumlin Boxing Club as a way to defend himself against bullies and raise his confidence.</p>

            <h3>Professional MMA Career</h3>
            <p>McGregor made his MMA debut in 2007 and quickly rose through the ranks. In 2013, he signed with the UFC and became one of the biggest stars in combat sports. His accomplishments include being the first UFC fighter to hold titles in two divisions simultaneously, and setting pay-per-view records in both MMA and boxing. His bouts, particularly with Nate Diaz, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and his boxing match with Floyd Mayweather Jr., are legendary in the world of combat sports.</p>
